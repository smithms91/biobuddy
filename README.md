Biobuddy. Inspired by a video I seen on youtube. Enter some information about you or a current bio and choose a mood and get a few AI generated bios. Built with NextJS and some DB for storing likes (i havent chose yet or many not need). Hosted with Vercel and using Vercel edge functions to stream generated responses in real time to client. Cool!
