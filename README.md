Biobuddy. Inspired by a video I seen on youtube. Enter some information about you or a current bio and choose a mood and get a few AI generated bios. Built with NextJS and MongoDB for storing the amount of bios created). Hosted with Vercel. Cool!

todo: use Vercel edge functions to stream generated responses in real time to client
